Heartnotes was based on a craft project I made last summer, for my best friend, since we were moving to opposite sides of the country for school.
The craft idea was a jar filled with little slips of paper, each containing a song, memory, or pep talk. 
The jar is meant to be a support when a friend can't be physically there. Pull out a note for a bit of encouragement or cheer when you're feeling down.

<p>Heartnotes the website expands on this concept, allowing a jar built not just by one friend, 
but by all of your friends. The person organizing the jar can make an account for the eventual recipient, 
go to account information and share the url with uniqueID. Other users, logged in or not, can choose the type of content they want to upload, 
and fill it in. The form will not submit unless all elements that need to be filled are filled.  Logged in users can view their submitted notes, 
and whether or not they were read.  After the friends have all submitted notes for the virtual jar, the organizer can give the recipient the login username and password. 
Then, the recipient can check back for today's note every day, where a new note will automatically appear.  If that day's note was sent by a registered user, 
the recipient can send a note back. The recipient can also look back at past notes.
