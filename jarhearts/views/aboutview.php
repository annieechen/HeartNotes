    About Us!
    </h1>
<p>
    Created by Annie Chen, a freshman at Yale in Ezra Stiles college, for the CS50 Final Project. 
</p>
<p>
    Although this project consumed her life for the past three weeks, she thinks it was worth it, as her mother was mildly impressed.
Just kidding. Although her mother still thinks she is an English Major, Annie has been inspired by CS50 to continue programming and working with tech, 
working towards her goal of a career in educational technology. Ideally, she will eventually spend her days contemplating how technology can help educators make learning in formal education more intuitive.
